### Application Load Balancer (v2)

- Application load balancers is Layer 7 (HTTP)
- Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
- Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine (ex: containers)
- Support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket 
- Support redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS for example)


- Routing tables to different target groups 
	- Routing based on path in URL 
	- Routing based on hostname in URL
	- Routing based on Query String, Headers 

- ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application 
- Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS
- In comparison, we'd need multiple Classic Load Balancer per application 


**Target Groups** 

- EC2 instances (can be managed by an Auto Scaling Group) - HTTP 
- ECS tasks 
- Lambda functions 
- IP Addresses - must be private IPs 

- ALB can route to multiple target groups 
- Health checks are at the target group level 

- Fixed hostname (XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
- The application servers don't see the IP of the client directly 
	- The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For 
- We can also get Port and proto 


```
#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y 
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

### Network Load Balancer (v2)

- Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow to :
	- Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances 
	- Handle millions of request per seconds 
	- Ultra-low latency 

- NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP (helpful for whitelisting specific IP)


**Target Groups**
- EC2 instances 
- IP Addresses - must be private IPS 
- Application Load Balancer 
- Health Checks support the TCP,HTTP and HTTPS Protocols

### Gateway Load Balancer 

- Deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of 3rd party 
network virtual appliances in AWS 
- Example: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, Deep Packet Inspection Systems, payload manipulation 

- Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) - IP Packets
- Combines the following functions : 
	- **Transparent Network Gateway** - single entry/exit for all traffic 
	- Load Balancer - distributes traffic to your virtual appliances 
- Uses the **GENEVE** protocol port **6081** 


Gateway Load Balancer - Target Groups 

- EC2 instances 
- IP Addresses - must be private IPs

### Sticky Session (Session Affinity )

- It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer 
- This works for **Classic Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, and Network Load Balancer** 
- The "cookie" use for stickiness has an expiration date you control 
- Use case: make sure the user doesn't lose his session data 
- Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances 

### Sticky Session - Cookie Names 

- Application-based Cookies 
	- Custom cookie 
		- Generated by the target 
		- Can include any custom attributes required by the application 
		- Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
		- Don't use AWSALB, AWSALBAPp, or AWSALBTG (reserved for use by the ELB)
	- Application cookie 
		- Generated by the load balancer 
		- Cookie name is AWSALBAPP 
- Duration-based Cookies 
	- Cookie generated by the load balancer 
	- Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB

### Cross-Zone Load Balancing 

**With Cross Zone Load Balancing** : 
each load balancer instance distributes evenly 
	across all registered instances in all AZ 

**Without Cross Zone Load Balancing** : 
Requests are distributed in the instances of the 
node of the Elastic Load Balancer 


Application Load Balancer 
- Enabled by default (can be disabled at the Target Group level)
- No charges for inter AZ data 

Network Load Balancer & Gateway Load Balancer 
- Disabled by default 
- You pay charges ($) for inter AZ data if enabled 

Class Load Balancer 
- Disabled by default 
- No charges for inter AZ data if enabled

### SSL/TLS - Basics 

- An SSL Certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption)


- SSL refers to Secure Sockets Layer, used to encrypt connections 
- **TLS** refers to Transport Layer Security, which is a newer version 
- Nowadays, **TLS certificates are mainly used**, but people still refer as SSL

Server Name Indication (SNI)
- SNI solves the problem of loading multiple SSL 
certificates onto one web server (to server multiple websites)
- The server will then find the correct certificate, or return the default one

**Note** : 
- Only works for ALB &. NLB (newer generation), CloudFront 
- Does not work for CLB (older gen) 

### Elastic Load Balancers - SSL Certificates 

- Classic Load Balancer 
	- Support only one SSL certificate 
	- Must use multiple CLB for multiple hostname with multiple SSL certificates 
- Application Load Balancer (v2)
	- Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates  
	- User Server Name Indication (SNI) to make it work 

- Network Load Balancer (v2)
	- Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
