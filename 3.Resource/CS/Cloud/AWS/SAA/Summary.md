### Purpose 

I work as a cloud engineer that manages private cloud 
then private cloud and public cloud concept is the same 
so I guess the public cloud, 
so I want to acquire qulification named SAA Solution Archiecture Assoaction 

I used github workbook, but its commentary is not kind, 
so I make a LLM Programming with Gemini 

It helps SAA and later helps this kinds of workbook 

See you
