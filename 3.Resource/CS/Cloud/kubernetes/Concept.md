kubernetes is a orchestarion platform that helps you distribute and operate multiple containers efficiently. The system consists largely of a **Master Node** and multiple **Worker Node**

## **🧠 Master Node (Control Plane)**

The Master Node is the brain of the kubernetes cluster. It manages and controls the entire system - **scheduling workloads, maintaining cluster state, and handling updates.**

- **API Server**: The front door of the cluster. All commands (like kubectl) interact with the API server.
    
- **Scheduler**: Decides _which_ Pod runs on _which_ Worker Node based on resources and rules.
    
- **Controller Manager**: Watches the cluster and ensures that the actual state matches the desired state (e.g., restarts crashed Pods).
    
- **etcd**: A distributed key-value store. It stores the cluster’s configuration and current state.

## **🛠️ Worker Node**

The **Worker Node** is where the actual work happens. It runs the **Pods** (which hold your containers) and reports back to the Master.

- **kubelet**: An agent that receives tasks from the Master and runs Pods accordingly.
    
- **kube-proxy**: Handles networking, making sure traffic reaches the right Pod.
    
- **Container Runtime**: The actual software that runs containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).
