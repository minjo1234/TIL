- An **EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume** is a **network** drive you can attach to your instances while they run
- It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination 
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
- They are bound to a specific availability zone 


- Analogy: Think of them as a "network USB stick"
