## How can users access AWS ? 


- To access AWS, you have three options 
	- AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
	- AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) : protected by access keys 
	- AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) - for code : protected by access keys 
- Access Keys are generated through the AWS Console 
- Users manage their own access keys 
- Access Keys are secret, just like a password, Don't share them
