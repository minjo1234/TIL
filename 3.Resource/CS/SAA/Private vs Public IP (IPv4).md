- Networking has two sorts of IPs, IPv4 and IPv6:
	- IPv4: 1.1.60.10.240.
	- IPv6: 3ffe: 1900~~~


- In this course, we will only be using IPv4
- IPv4 is still the most common format used online.
- IPv6 is newer and solves problems for the Internet of Things (loT).

- IPv4 allows for 3.7 billion different addresses in the public space 
- IPv4: [0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]


## Private vs Public IP (IPv4)

Example 
- Web Server <-> www <-> Server (public)



### Public IP: 
- Public IP means the machine can be identified on the internet (WWW)
- Must be unique across the whole web (not two machines can have the same public IP)
- Can be geo-located easily 

### Private IP:
- Private IP means the machine ca only be identified on a private network only 
- The IP must be unique across the private network 
- BUT two different private networks (two companies) can have the same IPS
- Machines connect to WWW using a NAT + internet gateway ( a proxy )
- Only a specified range of IPS can be used as priavte IP
