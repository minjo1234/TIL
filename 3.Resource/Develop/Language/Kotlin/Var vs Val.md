var is updatable
val is nonupdatable

----

##  Primitive Type

## 1.All variable make val first , but you often use that you 

update val to variable
` Long vs long ` java vs Kotiln

## nullabel Variable

` var number3: Long? = 1_000L`

## Object Instantiate

- every variable declare var or val 
- If you not explicitly write type, type infer 
- Primitive Type, Reference type doesn't divide
- Variable which has nullable must have to attaching ? 
- if you instantiate object do not use attach new
