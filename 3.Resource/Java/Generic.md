Why you nee it Generic ?

When you need to use many data types  (ex String, Double, Integer, Boolean)
-> So you think using object type ? you studied in a good direction 

children cannot contain their parents 
(ex Integer -> Object x , Object -> Integer)

In this situation, Issue With passing argument of wrong type 
So Object Type Diversity good solution
But it has low stability (receive input wrong type)

If you make the class (Interger, String, Boolean, Double) has high stability
but the amount of code incrases

----------

# Generic 

1.generic can solve this problem
