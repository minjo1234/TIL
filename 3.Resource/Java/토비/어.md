스프링 # 스프링 부트

스프링 부트가 도대체 뭘 하고 있는가에 대해서 살펴보기 시작했다.
개발자들은 스프링 부트가 무엇인지 정확히 정의할 수 없다
Spring boo는 Spring을 기반으로 실무 기반형의 도구 기반형으로 빠른 개발을 도와주는 프레임워크입니다.

스프링을 기반으로 실무 환경에 사용 가능한 수준의 (독립실행형) 애플리케이션을 복잡한
고민 없이 빠르게 작성할 수 있게 도와주는 여러가지 도구의 모음이다.
== 복잡하게 생각안해도 되고 , 빠르게 개발할 수 있다. , 빠르게 만들지만 대규모 환경에서도 가능하도록 
많은 것을 추가하였다.

## 스프링 부트의 핵심 목표

1.매우 빠르고 광범위한 영역의 개발 
2.강한 주장과 즉시 적용 가능한 기술 조합을 제공, 필요에 따라 손쉽게 변형 가능
3.프로젝트에서 필요로 하는 다양한 비기능적인 기술(내장형 서버, 보안, 메트릭, 상태 체크, 외부 설정 방식) - 내장형 Tomcat
4.코드 생성이나 XML 설정을 필요로 하지 않음 - ex) pom.xml

Enterprise Meaning

enterprise software or enterprise application software is computer software user by organizations, not individual users

Spring Boot Started By Request, that \


Hypervisor is a software that can be used to run multiple virtual machines
on a single physical machine 

If I start web Application with just hello world 
Servlet Container is essential,
But they are old, complext, not easy to use 

When  I use simple Spring Boot Project, I have doubts a knowing complex web-inf structure, web-servlet compatibility 

However, standAlone Application have implemented a very simple way
to solve this problem, and all you need to do is register as a Spring Bean 
Finally, you can easily develop by running the application


Opinionated

Spring Boot is a Opionionated, so users do not have to worry too much 
and are very advantageous 
because they can develop as they decide

스프링 프레임워크의 설계 철학 

극단적인 유현함 추구
다양한 과점을 수용
Not opinionated
수많은 선택지를 다 포용
하지만...

스프링 부트의 설계 철학

Opionionated - 자기 주장이 강한
일단 정해주는 대로 빠르게 개발하고 고민은 나중에
스프링을 잘 활용하는 뛰어난 방법을 제공

vm ware structure

datacenter - cluster -> virtual machines it’s okay?

A virtual machine cluster is a group of interconnected physical servers (hosts) that pool resources to provide a unified environment for managing and running multiple virtual machines.

fiexable expansion

1.spring boot provide fiexable way, that have default structure and natural customizing 

2.if you understand how to use Spring Boot, you can reconstruction the way you want it without Spring boot 

3.Write Module only for me , the module is a simple technology and composition

Development method using Spring Boot

Accepts the technologies, configurations, and default settings determined by the boot

Utilize the setting change method using an external setting file 

Start development very quickly. can 

----

Misunderstandings and limitations of development using Spring Boot

1.Just write application function code
2.Can develop well, not know spring
3.Don't have to know showing that is not directly by spring boot
4.If the need technical arises, use searching

---

If you understand Spring boot

1.you can learn and apply how Spring boot utilize spring technology

2.technical that Spring boot Selected, composition by automatic, check the what default option

3.if you need Spring boot setting that you can composition update and extend project

4.Utilize spring boot module from by me 

----

In order to reuse Spring boot efficiently ,

If you want to understand Spring Boot efficiently
it is effective to look at its evolution process as well as its final appearance

as well as  same not only but also , but two words have difference
as well as is a information you know, 
not only but also is parallel

api meaning

---

@Controller   
function : return view 

@RestController
@Controller + @ResponseBody 
function : return Json Data 


If you test the api code , you can use httpie tool

web application movement

http : 
if you request the container (ex) naver, kakao, facebook )

Response
- Status Line : HTTP version, Status Code, Status Text
- Headers
- Message Body
