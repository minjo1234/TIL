# Refactoring 

### 1.Change Function Declaration 

A Function with a good name doesn't require you
to look at the code to see how to implemented You can understand just seeing by the name 

Method of Find out Good Name? 
Write Annotation in the Function, Make Annotation 
Try making a comment with the function name 

Parameter of Function 
- Determine context of Function inside  (ex Phone number formatting Function )
- Determine Dependencies ( ex )

2.Rename Variable 

Lamda is a very narrow range variable
So, Lamda inside variable doesn't make the hard 

Local Variable is a semantic name 
ex) method name loadReviews , so variable in the loadReviews

not using command, It is better to use reviews

3.Rename Field

- Record is a very important because data structure field name can refer to program Overall Program 
- Record data structure : data structure of tied up relevant specific data
- python directory, dicts
- C# record

--------

Record

Dto class -> record conversion
-> DTO is working to convey, so It must not be deformed in the middle
